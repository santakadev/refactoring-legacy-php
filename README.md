# Refactoring legacy PHP

In an ideal world Legacy Code would not exist. In an ideal world PHP language would not exist. But here we are in a real world working with PHP Legacy Code.

This are practices and techniques I've used for refactoring legacy (PHP) applications and libraries.

## Set up environment

Check if there is any "Install / Setup" documentation. If exists, try to follow and report and/or fix any issue you found in documentation or code

## Strategy

- Know the application
- Collect data
- Improve documentation
- Test coverage

## Basic tools setup

### Setup git

Why:
- Track your changes

```git init```

### Use Docker

Why:
- Avoid installing all dependencies in your host machine.
- Avoid downgrading your PHP and other packages versions of your host.
- Avoid working with multiple PHP and other packages versions in your host.
- Future PHP local migraton will be faster.

### Use Travis

Why:
- Automatic CI
- Syntax check against all PHP versions

Test PHP syntax against all PHP files:

```find . -name "*.php" -type f -exec php -l {} \;```

```yaml
language: php
php:
  - '5.4'
  - '5.5'
  - '5.6'
  - '7.0'
  - '7.1'
  - '7.2'
  - '7.3'
script: find . -name "*.php" -type f -exec php -l {} \;
```
### Setup composer

Why:
- Install development libraries
- Autoload
- Future migration of commited libraries

```composer init```

add  ```/vendor/``` to ```.gitignore```

If the app you are refactoring is a library add ```composer.lock``` to ```.gitignore``

Specify a license and the PHP versions that you are supporting. If it is a legacy app, you should probably start supporting deprecated PHP versions.

```json
{
    "name": "santakadev/refactoring-legacy-php",
    "license": "GPL-3.0",
    "authors": [],
    "require": {
        "php": "^5.4 || ^7.0"
    }
}
```
By now, do not replace commited libraries. They could have modifications with respect to their official distribution, and migrating now could be time consuming. Stick with this ultli you need to upgrade some of its dependencies. In that case, only migrate the target libraries.

Add composer to .travis.yml.

Â¿Is library?:
- Yes -> composer update
- No -> composer install

```yaml
before_script:
  - composer update
```

## Code review

Why:
- Get knowlage about the code you are working on.
- Priorize refactoring tasks.

Make a list of all code smell that you found

```
- PHP and HTML code merged
- Too long files
- Too long functions
- Unmeaningful names
- Bad folder structure
```

### Manual code review

### Tools: phploc, pdepend, phpmd, etc.

If it is a legacy app folder structure can be a mesh. Try not to modify it by now and instead use tools options to exclude 3rd party code.

```
|-php
   |- ctrl
   |- external -> 3rd party libraries
   |- inc
   |- lib
   |- utilities
```

```sh
phploc --exclude external php
pdepend --summary-xml=pdepend.xml --ignore=external php
```

### phploc



### Setup PHPUnit

### Acceptance testing
